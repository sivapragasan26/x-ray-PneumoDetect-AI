## 📊 **Proof of Reliability**

### **🔬 Rigorous Dual Validation**

| Validation Type | Dataset | Sample Size | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Internal** | [Training Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) | 269 samples | Model development |
| **Cross-Operator** | [Independent Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamtanmayshukla/pneumonia-radiography-dataset) | 485 samples | Real-world testing |

While both datasets originate from Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, our validation set represents distinct patient cohorts with no overlap with training data, independent radiology review teams, and separate quality control pipelines. This constitutes an independent cohort within the same institution, sometimes referred to as cross-operator validation.

### **📈 Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Internal | Cross-Operator | Drop | Clinical Significance |
|--------|----------|----------|------|----------------------|
| **Accuracy** | 94.8% | **86.0%** | 8.8% ↓ | ✅ Good generalization |
| **Sensitivity** | 89.6% | **96.4%** | 6.8% ↑ | ✅ Excellent screening |
| **Specificity** | 100.0% | **74.8%** | 25.2% ↓ | ⚠️ Acceptable for screening |
| **ROC-AUC** | 98.8% | **96.4%** | 2.4% ↓ | ✅ Outstanding discrimination |

### **🏥 Clinical Interpretation**
The **96.4% sensitivity** means this system catches 96 out of 100 pneumonia cases, which is excellent for initial screening. The **25.2% false positive rate** is acceptable for a screening tool, as it's better to flag healthy cases for review than miss pneumonia cases.

## 📊 **Datasets & Preprocessing**

### **📁 Data Sources**
**Important:** Datasets are NOT included in repository. Manual download required:

* **Training Data:** [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) with ~1GB dataset (pediatric patients, ages 1 to 5)
* **Cross-Operator Validation:** [Pneumonia Radiography Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamtanmayshukla/pneumonia-radiography-dataset) with 485 samples (pediatric patients, ages 1 to 5)

### **Key Differences Between Datasets**

| Aspect | Training Dataset (Mooney et al., Cell 2018) | Cross-Operator Dataset (Pratibha-verified "Radiography") |
|---|---|---|
| Source & Cohort | Guangzhou Women & Children's Medical Center; retrospective X-rays of patients **1–5 yrs** collected for routine care. | Same hospital but **different acquisition teams & radiology reviewers** (hence "cross-operator"); images were re-exported and re-audited independently. |
| Size & Split | **5,863 images** already split into `train / test / val`. | **4,929 images** (1,249 Normal, 3,680 Pneumonia) also in `train / test / val`, but class counts differ. |
| Pneumonia Sub-types | Label is binary (Pneumonia vs Normal). | Pneumonia folder contains **Bacterial (2,435) vs Viral (1,245)** counts (still used as a single "Pneumonia" class in our model). |
| Quality-Control Pipeline | Two expert physicians graded all scans; a third physician double-checked the evaluation split. | All low-quality scans **manually removed**; initial dual-review + final audit by **Dr. Pratibha (senior radiologist)**. |
| Label Consistency | Labels follow original Cell 2018 study protocol. | Labels re-verified in 2024 audit; eliminates a handful of mis-labels reported in the original set. |
| Class Balance | Roughly **3.3×** more Pneumonia than Normal (4,273 vs 1,583); imbalance handled later by our balancing script. | Imbalance even higher (**≈3×**), but counts differ → provides a *new* distribution for robustness testing. |
| File Provenance | JPEGs exported directly from PACS in 2017-2018. | Same imaging hardware, but **different technologists (operators)** and separate export batch → tests operator-to-operator variation (cross-operator generalization). |
| Licensing | CC BY 4.0. | CC0 (public domain). |

**Why This Matters for the Model**  
* The **training dataset** teaches the network typical pediatric patterns under one operator workflow.  
* The **cross-operator dataset** probes generalization when image export settings, technicians, and a fresh radiology audit change, mirroring real-world variability.  
* Using both ensures the model is not just memorizing plate-specific noise or labeling quirks and gives the reported **86% accuracy / 96% sensitivity** on truly independent data.

### **🔄 Preprocessing Pipeline:**
1. Download datasets from provided Kaggle links
2. Run `python scripts/analyze_and_balance.py` for data analysis
3. Execute `python scripts/create_balanced_dataset.py` for preprocessing
4. Balanced datasets created locally (1K+ training images)

## ⚠️ **Medical Disclaimers**

### **🚨 Critical Limitations**
* **Research Prototype** is NOT a medical device or FDA/CE approved
* **Screening Tool Only** is NOT for definitive diagnosis
* **Professional Review Required** as all results need radiologist oversight
* **25.2% False Positive Rate** means 1 in 4 normal cases may be flagged incorrectly
* **Pediatric Focus** is optimized for ages 1 to 5; performance on other age groups untested

### **📊 Technical Constraints**
* **Binary Classification** cannot detect specific pneumonia types
* **Image Quality Dependent** as performance degrades with poor quality scans
* **Dataset Limitations** include limited population and imaging protocol diversity
* **No Clinical Context** cannot consider patient history or symptoms

### **✅ Appropriate Use Cases**
* Academic research and methodology demonstration
* Educational AI in healthcare training
* Technical portfolio projects
* **NOT for clinical diagnosis or patient care decisions**
